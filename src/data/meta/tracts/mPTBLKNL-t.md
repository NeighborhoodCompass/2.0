Percent of the Population Identifying as Black or African American

### Why is this important?
Information on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights. States use these data to meet legislative redistricting principles. Race data also are used to promote equal employment opportunities and to assess racial disparities in health and environmental risks.

### About the Data
The percent of the total population reporting their race to be Black or African American and ethnicity as not Latino or Hispanic (except in the 1970 Census, which did not account for combined White and Latino or Hispanic). Ethnicity is a separate characteristic from race and individuals reporting their ethnicity to be Latino or Hispanic may also report a race description such as White or African American.
