## Total Population
Total Population

### Why is this important?
Total population indicates the number of people living in a selected area. It is used to calculate density, and other per capita data. Trends of population increase or decrease can help the City, County and other service providers know where infrastructure and other services may be needed.

### About the Data
These are Census tract population calculations based on 100% counts from the Decennial Census from each reported year. For 2010 they are simply the 100% counts. For years prior to 2010, calucaltions were made to allow current Census tract counts of the population. See the link below for more on the methodology used to do this.
