## Median Price Per Square Foot
Median Price Per Square Foot

### Why is this important?
Changes in the median price per square foot indicate whether general residential property values are rising, falling, or staying the same. The median value provides a stable metric less subject to skewing by individual values that are either extremely high or extremely low. This information should not be used to determine whether a particular sale value is appropriate, but rather to understand how trends are occurring throughout Durham's neighborhoods.

### About the Data
This temporary, embargoed data is sourced from Triangle MLS and was used to prepare a case study of the effectiveness of  reporting MLS data in the Compass. Values from 2010 through 2014 were adjusted to the 2014 Consumer Price Index (CPI) and calculated for neighborhoods using the script found here: (link). This measure will be sourced from the Durham County Tax Administration before publication.
